1. Titanic Data Analysis


This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset, showcasing essential data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization skills in Python. The dataset includes passenger attributes such as ID, Name, Age, Sex, Class, Embarked, and Survival status. Operations performed in this project include handling missing values, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizing the relationships between various factors and survival rates. Visualizations like histograms, bar plots, and correlation heatmaps help uncover patterns in passenger demographics and survival chances.


Skills Demonstrated
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib
Handling missing data and outliers
Feature engineering and encoding categorical variables
Basic Python operations (list, dictionary, NumPy, pandas)

This project serves as a showcase of my Python data analysis skills and can be extended to more advanced predictive models, such as logistic regression or decision trees, to predict passenger survival.



2. Student Performance Analysis


This project demonstrates basic Python skills such as data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization using libraries like NumPy, pandas, and Seaborn. The dataset includes student attributes such as ID, Name, Subject, Attendance, and Marks, with operations like handling missing values, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating performance scores based on attendance and marks. Visualizations like histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots help uncover patterns in student performance.
