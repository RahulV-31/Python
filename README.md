#Student Performance Analysis
This project demonstrates basic Python skills such as data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization using libraries like NumPy, pandas, and Seaborn. The dataset includes student attributes such as ID, Name, Subject, Attendance, and Marks, with operations like handling missing values, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating performance scores based on attendance and marks. Visualizations like histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots help uncover patterns in student performance.

Skills Demonstrated
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib
Handling missing data
Basic Python operations (list, dictionary, numpy, pandas)
This project serves as a showcase of my Python data analysis skills and can be extended to more complex predictive models or systems.
